# Community Software Analysis Proposal
Please edit this file and push to your repository.

## Software: *word2vec* 

word2vec provides a Python interface to the word2vec language processing technique created by Google in 2013, which models words as vectors and uses cosine similarity to determine their similarity. It is able to detect words that have similar/synonymous meanings while also being able to suggest words for sentences based on context.

### Notes/concerns/risks

Please comment on any anomalies or known risks to following this
project, if you were unable to answer any questions above, or
otherwise have concerns about the appropriateness of the software.  If
the project requires a contributor license agreement or other
procedural steps, please explain here.  "None at this time" is
acceptable for this question.

Only concern would be that the software hasn't been updated since last year, which doesn't meet the criteria listed in the README. The project seems "finished", so there haven't been a lot of major commits since 2015-16. However, after looking through it, I believe that it is still of reasonably high quality. I also haven't been able to get the test suite to pass completely but the package seems to be working fine in jupyter.
